## Execute Browserstack

### Run tests with Browserstack

1. Set your Browsesrstack credentials as environment variables, then execute in the command line:

```bash:
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="user_Abc123"
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="qQ6qyMtixyoLxJrps2xF"
```

2. Add the Browserstack's devices and machines where the tests will be executed to the `playwright.config.ts` file in projects by their projectname:

```typescript:
projects:[
    // name should be of the format browser@browser_version:os os_version@browserstack
    {
      name: 'chrome@desktop@browserstack',
    },
    {
      name: 'edge@desktop@browserstack',
    }
]
```

3. Run all tests locally
   `npm run test `

### Associate new tests with Browserstack

You have to associate your tests with the Browserstack's fixtures adding: `import { test } from '../browserstack/fixtures'`. This is an small test example:

```typescript:
import { test } from '../browserstack/fixtures'
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Use the test keyword to indicate you are creating a test and a proper description
test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Start: Navigation to a specific URL
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  // Arrange: Find locators
  const title = page.locator('.navbar__inner .navbar__title');
  // Assert: Test validation
  await expect.soft(title, 'Some message error').toHaveText('Playwright');
});
```

### Get reports from Browserstack

For reviewing the browserstack reports:

1. Go to: `https://automate.browserstack.com/dashboard/v2` and login.
2. There you can figure out the build execution, in this case: `playwright-fnf-testing-build-1`
3. In the build run you can see all the sessions where the tests were executed, the sessions that were configured in the `browser.capabilities.ts` file. These sessions should have the information about the browser, operative system and the version of the operative system: `fnf-testing with playwright BROWSER on desktop OS OS_VS`
4. In any session, you should see the description, capabilities, execution's status, execution's time, logs with the step by step and a video with the execution of the tests, where you can see all details about it and verify if the tests run OK or if they didn't run OK to check the errors.

### Run tests in your Local Browserstack

[For running your playwright tests locally](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/playwright/local-testing#Using_binary), you need to download the BrowserStack Local binary (depending on your local machineâ€™s environment). Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file, you can initiate the binary by running the command:

```bash:
./BrowserStackLocal --key YOUR_KEY --YOUR_TAGS
```

You can set the [Flags for Local binary](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/local-testing/binary-params) as you need. In this way, you can access to your Local Browserstack Console: `http://localhost:45454/`.

And finally execute your tests. Then you can see the reports in the same way that we explain in the last section, and additionally you can get more information about the connections while the tests were executed (Network logs).
